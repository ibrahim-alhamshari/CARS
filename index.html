                The transportation sector is a major energy consumer, accounting for roughly 29% of primary 
energy use in the United States. 80% of this energy is for on-road vehicles,which are 
predominantly powered by petroleum gasoline or diesel.

                electric vehicle technology must climb its own learning curve, driving down costs and improving 

             performance, to the point where it is more attractive than petroleum-powered vehicles.
